# Academy Overview

## Purpose:
* Traditional foundation based on timeless fundamentals, physics of music, and human psychology. Adapt Nadia Boulanger's principles towards students intending to write modern media music.
* End to end - the goal of music is ultimately storytelling via sound waves reaching human ears. In modern contexts, unless you have access to live performers, this means usually creating an audio file. Sheet music is merely a tool, and you want to be able to communicate to everyone, not just people who can read music. Compose, orchestrate, and produce music as soon as possible to remove fear of the unknown. Nobody wants to be stuck doing a hundred theoretical exercises before they can write a real piece of music.
* Expose early to as many dimensions of music as possible, so student can decide where to go deeper. Fundamentals in each of these areas can always be grown in later no matter how advanced you are.

## PREREQUISITES (or starter lessons):
* You can read notes on treble and bass clef
* You can identify intervals by number (e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 5th). Naming quality (e.g. minor/major) is optional

## Why start with counterpoint?
Human mind is designed to track numerous living organisms and aspects of the environment around us. Each entity is instinctively differentiated by how high or low its pitch is, its sound qualities or timbre, as well as its physical location in space (a sound arriving slightly sooner in one ear before the other allows us to locate the sound source in physical space). You can, for example, hear (and even comprehend) multiple conversations at once, while a siren blares in the distance, birds chirp, and leaves rustle. The sudden appearance of a sound source sticks out to us evolutionarily, to alert us of a new predator or environmental hazard. Similarly, the sudden disappearance of a sound lets us know something is wrong, like a family member falling unconscious or going missing.

This matches up with the evolution of western music. Chants, drones, organums came first, and harmony emerged as a byproduct of how those independent voices interacted.

Why begin with strict rules? We're forced to make the most interesting and effective musical decisions from the beginning, reducing the need to rely on trial and error for determining why something sounds good. The qualities of a particular melody or harmony can be judged objectively, without regards to subjective taste or style.

## Melodic Tension
* Gregorian chant example
* Height of tension graph = height of notes
* In early chants, music gained tension as the melody rose higher, and fell as it came back down and eventually reached the home key or starting note.
* Natural tension between semitones (e.g. B->C or F->E) is higher than whole tones

## Melody Writing - Strict 1 Voice Counterpoint
* Hanging pitches. Split counterpoint example with a big leap. Voices only move by step - leaps "create" a new voice.
* Single high point and low point - small scale storytelling/climax.
* Leaps followed by steps in opposite direction - creating a nice natural contour. Two leaps in a row can be disorienting.

2 VOICE COUNTERPOINT (1st SPECIES) - Treble only.
2 VOICE COUNTERPOINT (2nd SPECIES) - Treble only.

4-PART HARMONY WRITING
* Creation of a triad, 3 notes based off a single bass note
* Harmonic vs. melodic tension
* Why do we need 4 parts? So that we can satisfy both melodic and harmonic resolution. B->C in melody, G->C in bass naturally doubles one of the notes of a triad.
* Bass movement
* Cheat sheet to provide shortcuts in writing the other 3 voices given a certain bass movement
* Open vs. closed disposition

RULES:
0. If it sounds good, it is good.
..* Ultimately, music is all about what you can hear. Sheet music is merely one of many tools to help you reach your ultimate goal of creating a .mp3 or .wav file that either accompanies a piece of media, or that people will want to listen to on its own. The rules distill general principles based on the physics of music and how our brains perceive sound, and act as quick short cuts you can use to direct your mental energy more to the creative aspects of music rather than the basic mechanics. It's more important to stir the hearts of your audience than to appease a music theorist who's reading your score sheet.
1. The melody must be beautiful.
..* Self explanatory. You want to create a memorable melody that people will sing to themselves or have stuck in their heads. The melody is usually the most immediately prominent aspect of music. In most cases, this is the soprano (top line of counterpoint/harmony), as our ears are most sensitive to those high frequencies.
2. The voices must move independently.
..* In most cases, we want to gain the most sonority and color without using too many resources. 
..* Show example of 2-voice counterpoint that devolves into parallel octaves temporarily. This pulls the listener out of the music and the natural independence is lost. If you were at a dinner gathering and two people started talking in perfect synchronization, you'd be creeped out and think they're demon-possessed.
3. The inner voices should have minimal motion.
..* Our ear can make sense of the most outlandish chord changes as long as each individual voice moves smoothly and logically. As we learned earlier, leaps "hang" and "create" new voices, evolutionarily this can be a bit odd to our brain unless it's an outer voice (soprano or bass) which our brain can more easily track by nature of it being the highest or lowest sound information.

FUNCTION, TENSION, AND RESOLUTION: CADENCES

QUESTION AND ANSWER PHRASES
- Use analogy of storytelling. Is asking a question and immediately answering it satisfying?
- Use Jurassic park example - replace 2nd phrase half cadence with a PAC.
- A longer form story usually 1) raise questions 2) journey away from home before coming back home.

THE SOUND OF FILM MUSIC
So far, the exercises we've written sound childlike or "overly classical" to the average listener. However, the principles we practiced still apply to modern media music, we just need to make a few stylistic adjustments.
- Chord inversions, making the bass lead more smoothly, allowing you to apply counterpoint principles
- Modes, ranked brightest to darkest, all starting on C. This gives you the color or mood of music.
- Modal interchange - emotional complexity, playing with expectations and payoff.
- Chord extensions - harmonic richness
- Longer form storytelling and modulation
- Relaxing the counterpoint/harmony rules now that you know the guiding principles
